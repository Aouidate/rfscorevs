# RF-Score-VS 1.0

RF-Score-VS is a novel Random Forest-based scoring function for Virtual Screening which predicts binding affinity.
Its descriptors are based on RF-Score developed by Pedro Ballester et. al.
Presented binary implements RF-Score-VS v2, meaning, it counts atoms of certain types within a 12A radius, divided into 2A bins.

Presented repository contains scripts required to reproduce results included in publication introducing RF-Score-VS **[article submitted]**

## Standalone scoring function

The RF-Score-VS is available as a standalone scoring function with no dependencies required.
Usage instructions and detailed information about the binary are available in README.md file alongside binaries and in [separate repository](https://github.com/oddt/rfscorevs_binary).
